    <h1>Hi my name is KC!</h1> 
    <p>I go by she/hers pronouns.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a junior majoring in Creative Technology and Design. I love all things creative my hobbies also reflect that!</p>

    <p>For this course, I'm hoping to pick up some new skills with front end development. I'm also super stoked to meet more people in my major!</p>
