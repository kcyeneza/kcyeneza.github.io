    <h3>hello there!</h3>
    <p>My name is Katriel Yeneza, but all my life, I've gone by KC. I'm currently a student attending the University of Colorado Boulder, with the intent
        to graduate by Spring of 2024. Studying Creative Technology and Design complements my hobbies and interests perfectly and I love 
        learning and growing, based on the idea of designing! On my website you can learn more about me, find out some of my projects, and maybe even reach out!
    </p>
