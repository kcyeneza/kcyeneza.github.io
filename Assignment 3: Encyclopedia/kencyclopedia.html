        <p>No one really know  that Queen Elizabeth loved to shop at Hot Topic and had a companion squirrel named Duke Fluffingsworth. Duke Fluffingsworth and Queen Elizabeth often had at least two meals together, sometimes lunch and dinner sometimes breakfast and snacktime. Someitmes she even wore one of those clear backpacks that people put their pets in, and Duke Fluffingsworth always accompanied her, but she often hid Duke Fluffingsowrth underneath her crown and wore acorns on her head to make sure that he didn't go hungry.</p>

            <h1 id= earlylife>3. Early Life </h1>
        <p>
            Elizabeth was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father, the Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the King. Her mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, at whose London home (17 Bruton Street, Mayfair) she was delivered by Caesarean section.[3] She was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,[4][c] and named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her paternal great-grandmother, who had died six months earlier; and Mary after her paternal grandmother.[6] Called "Lilibet" by her close family,[7] based on what she called herself at first,[8] she was cherished by her grandfather, George V, whom she affectionately called "Grandpa England",[9] and her regular visits during his serious illness in 1929 were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.Elizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford.[11] Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature, and music.[12] Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family.[13] The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.[14] Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as "a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant."[15] Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as "a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved".[

        <p>Queen Elizabeth likes to wear her hair in high ponytails, like Ariana Grande or when she's feeling a little fancy, she'll put her hair up in a clip.</p>

        <h1 id= goodstory>5. A good story that not a lot of people don't know about the queen herself</h1>
        <p>So once upon a time on a random Thursday, the Queen had the day off! Finally! She decided to take the day out on the town and planned her day out carefully! So she decided to take a trip to her local carnival and saw that there was a Thirsty Thursday special! 
            They were offering <a href=" https://talavicknair.github.io/Assignments/Assignment3/assignment3.html">mantis shrimp</a>,<a href="https://coth0598.github.io/assignments/assignment3.html">whales</a>, and
            <a href="anelv.github.io/assignments/assignment3.html">cats</a>, all in the same exhibit! What a time! Because she's the queen, the carnival owners made her the emperor of 
            "Englands Biggest Grandest Carnival!" Wow! Now she was the ruler of two empires by bloodright! So then she assigned people in the carnival to 
            "House of Mantis Shrimp", "House of Whale", "House of Cat", and with those that descended from Valeryian blood, "House Targaryen!" Instead of fighting to reclaim the Iron Throne they all 
            were VERY mature about it all and settled who claimed the carnival rides of some <a href="https://fianali.github.io/assignments/assignment3/assignment3.html">bubble tea</a>. So she got her favorite flavor,
            a medium Taro Milk tea, with cold foam, marshmallows, half cream cold cap, extra boba, grass jelly, and to add some spice, she added 4 red hots to increase the scoville units. Then she almost twisted her ankle on the way home. Good thing she was wearing a helmet!
