    <h3>some things i've worked on!</h3>

    <h3>GLOWSTER</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCSoY6iuwUE">glow-ster</a> was my final project in OBJECT, worked on with a fellow classmate, Riley Meere. 
        In this project, we were intruiged by the restaurant industry and ways to improve the experience. 
        From here, we designed a coaster that changes colors overtime, depending on how recent the drink has been picked up. 
        using ADAFRUIT Playgrounds, touch sensors, neopixels, all programmed in C. 
        Riley designed the outer shell, and 3D printed the casing.

    <h3>COLOR-GARDEN</h3>
    <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/679360391">Color garden</a> was a simple project that uses tissue paper, folded into flowers and neopixels, strictly
        for aesthetics. Coded in C, the lights change color and the tissue paper is both functional and design-based to 
        diffuse the light and make the flowers appear as if they were glowing.

    <h3>SCARY-RECYCLED JELLYFISH</h3>
    <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/682286971?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=167244169">This jellyfish</a> was conceptualized on using multiple inputs and outputs. A potentiometer
        and a photolight sensor were both used to adjust the pitch of the screaming jellyfish and the led color change. When the potentiometer
        knob was turned, the sound would change pitch, and when the photolight sensor reacted to different lights, the led's would either change color 
        or remain the same. With this project, I also wanted to focus on the encasing, so I used a clear acrylic fruit container, as well as recycled 
        trash bags to make the jellyfish-like shape. All programmed in C.
