    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <h3>a few things worth knowing.</h3>
    <p>I was born in Kuwait City, and moved to Pagosa Springs, Colorado when I turned 5. It definitely took a lot of adjusting 
        relocating to such a small town, however, it definitely broadened my experience of life. In high school, I was very involved
        with band, music performance, and art, so naturally I gravitated towards a major that allowed me to be curious about creativity 
        and it's correspondance to technology. I've come a long way since high school, and fitness has become a big part of my life! I love
        staying active, and going to the gym has truly felt like one of the places where I can be most like myself. 
    </p>

<p>
    As I continue to grow, there are still many things that have stuck with me since day one. Something that I am so appreciative to 
    have, is a close relationship with my family. I have three sisters, all whom I'm extremely close with, and people that I consider my 
    best friends. We bond over a lot of the same hobbies, and it was my younger sister, Beatrice, that got me hooked on lifting!
    I also have so much adoration for my dad, Francis Yeneza. He has taught me about all the important qualities to maintaining a 
    balanced life, and in most ways I attribute my best qualities to him. My family has always been so supportive of my hobbies, which has 
    allowed me to pursue the things that I want to. 
</p>
    <br>
<p>
    I still also maintain a high level of interest towards music. I love making music and majoring in Creative Tech and Design
    has only encouraged my appreciation towards music. With technology, music has really trancended and it's super cool to be 
    a part of life where so many genres exist! Shameless plug for my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/kcyeneza?si=cc5dabb8b8f2491d">spotify</a>, 
    but you can find a lot more about me there, than I can ever put into words.
